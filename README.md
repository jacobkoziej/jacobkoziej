<h4>Hi there ツ</h4>
<p align="justify">
My name's Jacob, and I'm a high school junior majoring in mechatronics & robotics.
I'm in love with my work, and I don't think that feeling will be fading any time soon.
I adore tinkering with technology, and if there's one thing I've learned thus far,
it's that the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know.
